== 2.4.1 / 2008-04-03

* Comparing to ActiveSupport, found 63 extension clashes, but most are due to 1.9 features and the rest should be compatible.
* A much improved paramix.rb has been returned to the library; but please note it's not quite finished yet.
* Reatomized a number of Kernel and String methods. Reatomization is nearly complete.
* Deprecated behavior.rb. It was not robust.
* Added basex.rb, library for working in any encoding base using any character set (base62 is the default).
