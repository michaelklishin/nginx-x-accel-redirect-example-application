== 2.2.0 / 2007-12-13

* A lot of rdoc updates to core extensions --as promised ;)
* Just about every method now has at least a brief explinaiton and an example.
* integer/bitmask.rb has changed a bit --pun intended ;) Deprecated some methods and now use "~" instead of "-" to clear bits.
* The name Array#unzip didn't makes sense, it was renamed to #modulate (though #collate seems better?)
* Renamed Enumerable#collate to #mash (Map hASH); #collate and #graph remain aliases for the time being.
* Deprecated Module#include_and_extend. Just use both silly.
* More lib pp_s.rb has been removed. Use #pretty_inspect instead.
* Split binding extensions up a bit more finely --eval.rb sprouted here.rb, self.rb and defined.rb.
* Move Time#stamp out of conversion.rb and into time/ dir, and remove to_s alias.
* Preliminary addition of Matthew Harris' excellent duration.rb lib (will integrate with times.rb better in future).
* Added if clauses to handle upcoming Ruby 1.9 gracefully. Facets should now be just about ready for use with 1.9.
